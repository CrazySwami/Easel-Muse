## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20+)

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/haydenbleasel/Easel.git
   cd Easel
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```sh
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with your environment variables. Check the `lib/env.ts` file for all the variables you need to set.

4. Run the development server
   ```sh
   pnpm dev
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Usage

1. Login or create an account
2. Create a new project or open an existing one
3. Add nodes to your canvas by clicking the toolbar buttons
4. Connect nodes by dragging from one node's output to another node's input
5. Configure node settings as needed
6. Run your workflow to process data through the AI models

## Branding and App Name (reusing this project)

You can customize the product name and logo for reuse across projects.

### 1) Configure via environment

Add the following to `.env.local`:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME=Easel
NEXT_PUBLIC_LOGO_PATH=/Easel-Logo.svg
```

Wire these in code by importing `env` from `lib/env.ts` and referencing `env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME` and `env.NEXT_PUBLIC_LOGO_PATH` instead of hard‚Äëcoded strings. Typical places to use them:

- UI shell: `app/(unauthenticated)/components/header.tsx` (brand text next to the logo)
- Page titles/descriptions: `app/page.tsx`, `app/(unauthenticated)/home/page.tsx`, `app/(unauthenticated)/pricing/page.tsx`, `app/(authenticated)/projects*/page.tsx`
- Emails: `emails/*` subjects/body and `app/api/webhooks/resend/route.tsx`

Restart the dev server after adding new env variables.

### 2) Things you must change manually (not env‚Äëdriven)

- Package metadata: `package.json` ("name")
- Supabase project identifier: `supabase/config.toml` (`project_id`)
- Static assets: replace `public/Easel.png` (and update imports) or use `NEXT_PUBLIC_LOGO_PATH`
- Docs content: files under `docs/` and this `README.md`
- Hardcoded links to the public site/domain inside emails:
  - `emails/sign-up.tsx`, `emails/sign-in.tsx`, `emails/forgot-password.tsx` (`magicLink` values)
- Any remaining references to "Easel" in policy pages:
  - `app/(unauthenticated)/terms/page.tsx`
  - `app/(unauthenticated)/privacy/page.tsx`
  - `app/(unauthenticated)/acceptable-use/page.tsx`

Tip: to locate all references you may want to change, search the repo for `Easel` and `Easel`.
